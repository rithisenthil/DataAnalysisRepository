Rithi Senthil (Class of '27) Data Analysis Projects Showcase

Hi! My name is Rithi, I am a student at the Liberal Arts and Science Academy in Austin, Texas, and this is a collection of my data analysis projects that I made for my class in Bayesian data science. You can find the course content here https://github.com/thedarredondo/data-science-fundamentals/tree/main 

Each topic will usually have a project and notes.
  The project is where I apply my knowledge to a real data set that has captured my interest and build a model in python while also breaking it down in my own analysis
  The excersises are activites provided by mt teacher which I answer. These usually include content questions as well as a challenge where I am required to create a model that meets specified requirements.

The goal of this repo is to display my skills and the way I think / approach problems, if you have nay questions please reach out to me at rithi.senthil345@gmail.com

Enjoy :)
